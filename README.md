# LFT_unito2015-

Here is my LFT project made at Torino University in 2015. It's my first real project in java made by myself with no IDE support. 
Basically, the last exercise, is a transator for my simil-java language. It produces an Output.j file which is than compiled by jasmine.

-> For further information look at main(1).pdf file in the folder. (it is in italian, as the comments are...I'm sorry)
